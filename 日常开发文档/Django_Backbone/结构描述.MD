1.  后端提供 restful 服务组件 django-rest-framework
    http://www.django-rest-framework.org/
    
    a. url -> apps/management/url/restful.py
        
    
    b. view -> apps/management/views/restful.py
       doc : http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/views/
        
    c. template -> apps/management/templates/restful
        //rest-framework it self do not need a template, 
        // this template folder is for front-end backbone APP carrier
    
    d. serializers -> apps/core/serializers
       doc: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/
    
    e. we should use permission class to limit api access
       doc: http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/
       it also provide ability for third party access like O-auth
    
    f. 
      
2. 前端 requireJs + Backbone + customize 
    
    a. obstacles 
        1. integrate require js with django 
            problem : 
              in Guoku's Production Env, every version iteration will produce a new static path
              this make it very DifficutE to determine requireJs's BaseUrl in main file
              
            Answer:
              I have provided a workaround , see sentinel and main.js in /static/js/management/restful/main.js
            Still: 
              Need Test
              
        2. cross domain 
            problem : Guoku's js resource in static.guoku.com domain
                      While all the request is from admin.guoku.com/www.guoku.com 
                 
            Answer : js file itself can be loaded cross domain 
                      text file (like template) is not 
                      there already a plugin for TEXT 
                      BUT we can still provide template access via html inline , 
                          use <script type='template/text' id="XXX"><script>
                          inline template into the Django template file 
                          , later , if  cross Text request is success , 
                          we can switch template files into independent files.
            
            Still need test
        
        3. Data prensentation
