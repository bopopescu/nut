a short-term shop for long-term goods.
Craft goods, menswear, hand-picked vintage, home wares, womenswear, coffee and more.

It’s that time of the year when GUOKU.COM and LIGHTHOUSE SHOWROOM get all of our favorite brands and friends together in one space for two great weeks of 2016 BEIJING DESIGN WEEK.
It’s a celebration of good people selling well-made things.
It’s about discovering the new maker or rediscovering an old favorite.
We’d like to think there couldn’t be a better place to gift shop or buy things for yourself which is nearly as much fun in beijing.

We’ve got 10+ awesome brands offering a strong line-up of vintage, menswear, home goods, fine leather goods, footwear, accessories, engraved stationery and all sorts of other good things.
Even things for the ladies.

If you are interested in participating anytime, drop us a line via the GUOKU.COM contact.
So if you expect to see a great selection of new, vintage, home, menswear and other objects you won’t be disappointed.

Free entry. Open to the public.
